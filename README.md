unbeatable_tictactoe
====================

This is an unbeatable game of Tic Tac Toe, with significantly better performance than a Minimax algorithm-based solution.

There are a few command line options:

1.  Play an ordinary game, you first, with `ruby game_loop.rb`
2.  Let the AI play first with `ruby game_loop.rb ai-first`
3.  Finally, you can run the program N times with `ruby game_loop.rb test 1000` (replace 1000 with whatever number you like, obvs) to display a summary of game outcomes.
